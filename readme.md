# Microservice Design Document

## Objective

Design a microservice that efficiently processes **billions of records** while meeting strict performance SLAs (P99 < 500ms). This document captures **architectural decisions, trade-offs, and deployment strategy**.

---

## Functional Requirements

- **POST /data** – Accept and validate JSON payload, persist to DB  
- **GET /data** – Retrieve data with sub-500ms latency  
- **Scalability** – Billions of records with <10% degradation  

---

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Flow

````

Client → CloudFront → WAF → ALB → NGINX Ingress → API Pods → Service Layer → DB/Cache/Kafka

```

### Key Components

1. **API Layer**
   - Request parsing, validation (JSON schema)  
   - Authentication & authorization  
   - Response generation  

2. **Service Layer**
   - Encapsulates business logic  
   - Manages caching (Redis)  
   - Publishes async events to Kafka  

3. **Data Layer**
   - **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** for ACID + time-series workloads  
   - **Redis Cluster** for caching hot data (5-min TTL)  
   - **Kafka (MSK)** for event-driven processing  

---

## Technology Trade-offs

### Database
- **PostgreSQL (chosen)**: ACID compliance, relational queries, mature ecosystem, partitioning (TimescaleDB).  
- **MongoDB**: Flexible schema, but weaker consistency and slower for joins.  
- **DynamoDB**: Fully managed and horizontally scalable, but expensive and eventually consistent.  

**Why PostgreSQL?** We require **financial-grade consistency**, efficient queries, and ability to partition billions of rows while keeping operational complexity manageable.

---

### Message Broker
- **Kafka (chosen)**: Designed for **high-throughput streaming** (2M msgs/sec), event replay, and durability.  
- **RabbitMQ**: Simpler, great for traditional queues, but throughput peaks around 50k msgs/sec.  
- **SQS**: Fully managed, low ops burden, but lacks streaming semantics and has higher latency.  

**Why Kafka?** The system requires **both high throughput and event sourcing capabilities**.

---

### Cache
- **Redis (chosen)**: Sub-millisecond latency, advanced data types, persistence options.  
- **Memcached**: Slightly faster for simple key-value lookups, but lacks persistence and clustering features.  

**Why Redis?** It provides **rich functionality with minimal performance trade-offs**, suitable for caching and queue-like workloads.

---

### Orchestration
- **Kubernetes (chosen)**: Standardized ecosystem, autoscaling, portability.  
- **ECS**: Lower operational overhead on AWS, but vendor lock-in.  
- **Nomad**: Flexible, simpler than Kubernetes, but lower adoption and ecosystem support.  

**Why Kubernetes?** The **ecosystem maturity** and team experience outweighed ECS simplicity.

---

### Service Mesh
- **Istio (chosen)**: mTLS, observability, advanced traffic control.  
- **Linkerd**: Simpler, faster, but fewer features.  

**Why Istio?** We needed **observability + security out of the box**, and were willing to accept 1–2ms latency overhead.

---

### Monitoring
- **Prometheus (chosen)**: Open-source, cost-efficient, integrates with Grafana.  
- **DataDog**: Rich UI and out-of-the-box integrations, but ~$750/month more expensive.  
- **CloudWatch**: Fully managed but less flexible for custom metrics.  

**Why Prometheus?** At our scale, **cost optimization + flexibility** outweighed ease of use.

---

## Containerization

- Multi-stage builds keep images < 20MB  
- Local development via Docker Compose  
- Production: ECR storage with vulnerability scanning  

---

## Deployment (AWS EKS)

- 3 worker nodes (c5.2xlarge) across availability zones  
- HPA scaling 3–50 pods  
- Auto-scaling tuned to avoid GC pauses at 80% CPU  
- Istio service mesh for mTLS and tracing  

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions stages:
  - Linting & formatting  
  - Unit & integration tests  
  - Docker build & push  
  - Kubernetes deploy via `kubectl`  

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests** – validation, persistence logic  
- **Integration tests** – API + DB consistency  
- **Load tests** – sustained 10k RPS, P99 <500ms  
- **Future** – Chaos testing, long-running soak tests  

---

## Observability

- Prometheus + Grafana – metrics, dashboards  
- ELK stack – structured logs (7 days hot, 30 days warm, 1y cold)  
- Jaeger – distributed tracing (1% sampling)  

---

## Cost Analysis (AWS)

- Compute (EKS): $1,100/month  
- Database (RDS): $3,200/month  
- Cache (Redis): $450/month  
- Kafka (MSK): $600/month  
- Monitoring & Storage: $350/month  
- **Total**: ~$5,700/month  

---

## Future Roadmap

- Multi-region active-active via Global Accelerator  
- Aurora Serverless v2 evaluation  
- Spot instances for cost savings  
- GraphQL API for more flexible queries  

---

## Conclusion

This design deliberately balances **scalability, performance, and cost**. Each choice was made after considering alternatives, highlighting trade-offs, and aligning with the requirements of a microservice expected to handle **billions of records under strict SLAs**.
